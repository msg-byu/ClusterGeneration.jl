Started a proper repo for the code.  
Moving each block of code (each "method") into functions, so ideas are easier to explore.  

My initial attempts generated a PI matrix with a higher rank than the default uncle approach, but they still weren't full rank. As a debugging strategy, I'm going to run tests without trying to remove any translation or  rotation duplicates, even for identical figures with equivalent but permuted s-vectors.
